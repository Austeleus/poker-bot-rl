# CLAUDE.md - Poker Bot Project Context

Rules for Claude:
1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.

The todo.md file contains what you have done and what you should do.

## Project Overview

This is a world-class poker bot implementation for 3-player Texas Hold'em No-Limit using **Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR)** as the core algorithm. 
In particular, I want to use the open source poker bot, DecisionHoldem, to create my heads up poker bot blue print. The link to the github repo is https://github.com/AI-Decision/DecisionHoldem
I want to use DecisionHoldem in order to create a baseline heads up model, with 3 goals:
1) to add a KL‑regularised Reinforcement Learning “exploit” wrapper, which seeks to exploit worse opponents while minimizing increase in own exploitability
2) to distill tabular strategies to a policy-value neural network (Deep CFR) and add a 1-second sub-game resolve
3) to implement a 3-handed holdem bot. (This will for sure decrease the quality of our headsup bot, but as long as it can play semi-well, I will be happy)

# Using Gemini CLI for Large Codebase Analysis

When analyzing large codebases or multiple files that might exceed context limits, use the Gemini CLI with its massive
context window. Use `gemini -p` to leverage Google Gemini's large context capacity.

## File and Directory Inclusion Syntax

Use the `@` syntax to include files and directories in your Gemini prompts. The paths should be relative to WHERE you run the
  gemini command:

### Examples (some example files are not actually in this project):

**Single file analysis:**
gemini -p "@src/main.py Explain this file's purpose and structure"

Multiple files:
gemini -p "@package.json @src/index.js Analyze the dependencies used in the code"

Entire directory:
gemini -p "@src/ Summarize the architecture of this codebase"

Multiple directories:
gemini -p "@src/ @tests/ Analyze test coverage for the source code"

Current directory and subdirectories:
gemini -p "@./ Give me an overview of this entire project"

# Or use --all_files flag:
gemini --all_files -p "Analyze the project structure and dependencies"

Implementation Verification Examples

Check if a feature is implemented:
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ Has dark mode been implemented in this codebase? Show me the relevant files and functions"

Verify authentication implementation:
gemini -p "@src/ @middleware/ Is JWT authentication implemented? List all auth-related endpoints and middleware"

Check for specific patterns:
gemini -p "@src/ Are there any React hooks that handle WebSocket connections? List them with file paths"

Verify error handling:
gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Is proper error handling implemented for all API endpoints? Show examples of try-catch blocks"

Check for rate limiting:
gemini -p "@backend/ @middleware/ Is rate limiting implemented for the API? Show the implementation details"

Verify caching strategy:
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ @services/ Is Redis caching implemented? List all cache-related functions and their usage"

Check for specific security measures:
gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Are SQL injection protections implemented? Show how user inputs are sanitized"

Verify test coverage for features:
gemini -p "@src/payment/ @tests/ Is the payment processing module fully tested? List all test cases"

When to Use Gemini CLI

Use gemini -p when:
- Analyzing entire codebases or large directories
- Comparing multiple large files
- Need to understand project-wide patterns or architecture
- Current context window is insufficient for the task
- Working with files totaling more than 100KB
- Verifying if specific features, patterns, or security measures are implemented
- Checking for the presence of certain coding patterns across the entire codebase

Important Notes

- Paths in @ syntax are relative to your current working directory when invoking gemini
- The CLI will include file contents directly in the context
- No need for --yolo flag for read-only analysis
- Gemini's context window can handle entire codebases that would overflow Claude's context
- When checking implementations, be specific about what you're looking for to get accurate results
